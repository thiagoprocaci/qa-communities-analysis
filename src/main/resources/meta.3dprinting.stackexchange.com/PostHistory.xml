Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" />

Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't *think* about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that &quot;I must solve it this way&quot; and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is *part of the problem*. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like &quot;It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just *happens* to be an alternative&quot;, but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast.

There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do agree that, so far, the [tag:legal] questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in [a comment](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have the same situation here. Some [tag:legal] questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say that all [tag:legal] questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow [tag:legal] questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet." />

We may link to outside models, but the core API should be servable by stack exchange without license or much maintenance so 1) we don't have to deal with API changes messing us up, 2) we don't rely on outside services that may change their terms of use or API, 3) we don't have to form complicated contract bound relationships with 3rd parties just to get the guarantees we'd need to convince Stack Exchange to invest in a new feature, and 4) we don't become too politically involved such that we disenfranchise users who may have very strong feelings about this subject.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Wait and see&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the early beta.  Let's find out what people link to in questions before dedicating resources to improving the links/plug-ins/oneboxes.

But when I started 3D-printing, that's certainly where a large part of my questions lay. It's because the materials are DIFFERENT than ones we're used to dealing with, and if it weren't for 3D-printing, I wouldn't have been working with them then. It's BECAUSE I was 3D-printing that the questions arose. There are certainly similarities between the materials used for 3D-printing and other materials we might run into, but there are also vast differences. For example, ABS is the same plastic that we know from Legos. But how does working with the plastic that's been 3D-printed differ from working with a Lego? I would consider any question about that area to be valid. You mention drilling plastic, but then got the answer wrong. It is NOT like drilling wood; the way you drill plastic should be different from how you deal with wood, such as the speeds used and the use of hand drills. There are even special plastic bits that you can buy that make it easier to drill plastic. Good questions might be: for PLA, ABS and other 3dpg plastics, when is it appropriate to use such bits and when can you get away with using high speed drill bits like you would use for wood? Are higher drill speeds better than lower speeds for some 3D-printed plastics and not others, or vice versa?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, I feel that questions about a technique or material that is being used in the 3D-printing process, or dealing with the materials afterward, should be valid because 3D-printing changes how the techniques are done or the materials are dealt with." />

As such, I disagree with [tbm0115's suggestion][2] that we should artificially delay closing a question (at this stage in the sites life there aren't enough people closing questions as it is) and suggest that we always close a poor question as soon as possible, but give people the information they need to fix the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead, I offer the following suggestion:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If you want to vote to close a question without writing a comment to say why, with suggestions as to how to fix the problem, think about how this looks to a new user and how they might feel about the *rejection*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If people assume there is nothing they can do about their question being closed, and this drives them away, then we should do all we can to correct that misunderstanding, encourage them to learn how Stack Exchange works and ask better questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, don't forget the importance of [broken windows theory][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The quicker poor questions are closed, the higher the good:bad question ratio is, the more likely new users will see examples of good questions, and the less likely that they will base their own question on a poor example of a question. This is why good questions are the most important thing on a new site. They draw in experts to answer them and they set a good example for how new questions should be framed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, close early, close often, and comment with the information needed to get the question re-opened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/a/177/37&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/112/63&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory" />

I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Search Engines#&#xD;&#xA;Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***Extruder keeps jamming*** as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament*** as a question title is more specific and contains more &quot;keywords&quot; that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Etiquette#&#xD;&#xA;I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to &quot;advertise&quot; the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend &quot;advertising&quot; the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&amp;A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully this helps" />

This just allows you to make copies of an existing model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we want to allow these types of questions, we should get the name of this site changed (to something like &quot;Makers SE&quot;/&quot;Rapid Prototyping&quot;). I don't know if that's even an option, but as it stands, &quot;3D printing SE&quot; should be about 3D printing; CNC mills, vacuum formers, etc... are *clearly not 3D printers* and thus off-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't find &quot;there's no other place for this&quot; to be a convincing argument; the scope of a site should not depend on what other sites do or do not exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I do feel the just 3D printing scope is a bit limited and we could attract a larger audience by including other types of rapid prototyping/manufacturing. The name would be a huge misnomer if the scope included that, but I guess the only way to get a name change (if that is possible/appropriate at all) is to begin by changing the scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As it stands, the question referenced in the post is definitely not on-topic (since the machine involved is very un-printer-like), but questions about CNC machines (and similar machines) *might* be. They mostly run different softwares (GRBL/Mach3) but you could conceivably run a CNC machine on Marlin." />

The problem is that Stack Exchange isn't meant to be a search engine or a list of links. We have Google for that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our role in making the Internet a better place is in curating a high-quality collection of crowd-sourced knowledge. Stack Exchange rates very highly among search engines, so when someone clicks through thinking they finally found an answer from a highly-trusted source, **we have a responsibility *not* to purport having information we do not.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes it's better to accept not-perfect-answer than leave the man with no answer at all&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's a well-meaning consideration, but it ignores the purpose of curating this content as a whole. You may help that *one* person in the minimal possible sense&amp;hellip; but for the hundreds (sometimes *thousands*) of people who come after, all we did was create yet **another barrier** between the user and the information they were searching for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That does not make the Internet better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Redirecting users elsewhere can also displace folks who may have posted a *proper* answer. Few people are actually privy to these meta discussions and what makes these Stack Exchange sites &quot;work&quot;, so oftentimes users looking on will largely consider the issue *resolved.* Folks mostly emulate the practices and methods they see, so if cutting and pasting a link serves as an answer, then *everyone* can do it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And in that vein, please do not answer questions in comments. Comments do not have the voting and the wiki-style editing features which allow us to properly vet and improve this content.

Winter Bash is an annual event that can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [![hats][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The Details**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackpromos.com/promos/16/winter-bash-2015&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg" />

Most of my questions/answers have received votes, whereas on other (nameless) sites, I have posted a number of questions/answers and not received [m]any votes at all. However, this must be my (inaccurate) perception, as the stats shows that the voting is not at the desired levels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While it is important to votes and vote often, it is worth remembering that we shouldn't just vote willy-nilly. I have noticed that some beta sites, especially in the early days, tend to get rather frenzied (or, if you will, overly enthusiastic) voting, which one does not necessarily see in the more established sites, where the voting has settled down and only the (oft mentioned) *awesome* answers are voted for. This overly enthusiastic voting can *sometimes* end up giving random votes to questions that are not particularly researched, or answers that are not fully accurate, which maybe do not deserve any votes at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not sure why this (comparatively) frenzied voting occurs, or why it dies down, nor am I sure what (which?) level of voting is appropriate - although it is obvious that poorly researched questions and inaccurate answers should not be voted up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless, I would agree that voting *does* act as an incentive to contribute to the site, as well as the idea that voting for a good question, or accurate answer, even if that question/answer does not apply directly to you, because it will help other users.

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation.

Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator, they will:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Organize the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Essentially, **they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.&#xD;&#xA;- Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.&#xD;&#xA;- If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.&#xD;&#xA;- If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.&#xD;&#xA;- The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. &#xD;&#xA;- Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read [*A Theory of Moderation*][2] thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into [chat room][3] where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room).

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" />

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" />

There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do agree that, so far, the [tag:legal] questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in [a comment](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have the same situation here. Some [tag:legal] questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say that all [tag:legal] questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow [tag:legal] questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet." />

PLA&lt;sup&gt;[filament]&lt;/sup&gt;, ABS&lt;sup&gt;[filament]&lt;/sup&gt;, Stainless Steel&lt;sup&gt;[powder]&lt;/sup&gt;, Bronze&lt;sup&gt;[powder]&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Focusing on material questions may be a good start to the concern. While it may be technically *too broad* asking materials questions, in reality, most questions (in FDM/FFF realm) are going to be either about PLA or ABS (maybe Nylon) unless there is a specified purpose for the object. So, if a user specifies (or hints) the preferred printing method (FDM/FFF, SLA, etc.) then I think we should let people use their better judgment in answering the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Would it be appropriate to consider re-opening closed questions with the before mentioned criteria?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed%3Ayes&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111/closing-locking-too-many-questions" />

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" />

It doesn't always work, depending on the length of time that the question has been posted for and some other factors, but often it does work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer to &quot;Why?&quot; is simply because it hasn't been set up by the moderators. Generally, a specific migration &quot;pathway&quot; has to be agreed between sites, I think, and only then is that particular SE site *manually added* as an option to the migration dialog. There is a post, from a few years ago, on SE.Arduino - See [Why does the migrate dialog only list Arduino Meta?](https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2340/why-does-the-migrate-dialog-only-list-arduino-meta). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, I was mistaken, although, I am sure that I heard the above from someone, somewhere. Apparently, it is because SE 3D Printing is still in beta:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I think it is because we are &quot;only&quot; a Beta site. Once we graduate, I&#xD;&#xA;&gt; think more migrating options become available.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; As a moderator, I can migrate to other sites, and have done in some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cases. I usually ask their moderators first, and quite often they&#xD;&#xA;&gt; decline to accept them. However migration does happen.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I think there is some rule that Beta sites don't get to migrate to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; other sites. I'm not quite sure why such a rule exists (it would seem&#xD;&#xA;&gt; more logical for it to be the other way).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See also, from SE Robotics, [Closing a question - only option for another site is Robotics Meta][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### Migrating to an arbitrary stack exchange site&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is only an option for ♦ moderators, so instead of voting to close&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the question &lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt; you should flag it for moderator&#xD;&#xA;&gt; attention &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ddagger;&lt;/sup&gt; with a suggestion of where it should be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; migrated.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; On established sites, migration paths are created to allow migration&#xD;&#xA;&gt; without moderator approval, but any migrations outside of those&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pathways still have to be handled by a moderator. The reason for this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is because...&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### This specific question&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would not be a good candidate for migration. We try not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to migrate questions which would just be closed on the target site for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; another reason. In this case, it is a very broad question. It could be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; edited to be a more *[practical, answerable questions based on actual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; problems faced](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask)* but&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that may invalidate the existing answer, which is pretty good, given&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the limitations of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If neither [Computer Science][2] nor [Signal Processing][3] want this&#xD;&#xA;&gt; question, I'm happy for it to remain on *robitics*, since there are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; robotic applications of the answer to this question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &amp;dagger;&lt;sub&gt; *close &gt; off-topic because... &gt; This question belongs on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; another site in the Stack Exchange network*&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &amp;ddagger;&lt;sub&gt; *flag &gt;  in need of moderator intervention*&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See also [What are the limitations in Beta][4], in particular [animuson's answer][5]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Beta sites don't have default migration paths (although moderators can still migrate to/from).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1287/closing-a-question-only-option-for-another-site-is-robotics-meta&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cs.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://dsp.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/296832/what-are-the-limitations-in-beta&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/296832/what-are-the-limitations-in-beta#answer-296833" />

The 3D printing market is growing; but, it is still a pretty small niche compared to broader subjects like Programming, Engineering, Cooking, etc.&#xD;&#xA; 2. 3D printers are really pretty simple compared to the other topics I mentioned above.  There aren't going to be as many questions.&#xD;&#xA; 3. There is a wide diversity of printers and most commercial (non RepRap) printers are supported by the individual manufacturer's forums.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, 753 visits/day (which is less than the number of people in the launch) and 2.1 questions/day is pretty pathetic.  I think pretty much every 3D Printing forum, Facebook group, and YouTube channel WAY exceeds those numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Only being able to ask and answer questions is a BIG limitation**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3D Printing is part of the general Maker Culture and Makers want to not just ask; but, they want to show off and talk about what they make.

Lots of questions on StackOverflow come from students and nubies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;**So, what can we do?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Broaden our scope from just &quot;3D Printing&quot;.  The original Beta description is &quot;tools and applications of 3D printing&quot; which is a bit wider.  Maybe we should try to get more CAD, scanning, and maybe even CNC questions.&#xD;&#xA; 2. I wonder if Stack Exchange would be interested in getting a booth at our local Maker Faires.  They seem to be willing to partner money with effort and a booth is pretty cheap if we can muster the manpower.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Could we do a [community-ad](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/237281/community-ads-faq).  It looks like they may be [taking requests](https://meta.serverfault.com/questions/9028/community-promotion-ads-2017/9040) now.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Maybe we could partner with someone to do a &quot;Print-a-thon&quot; or printing contest.  They could post the results and push the questions to us.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Find a way to connect to schools that have printing and/or CAD classes or after-school activities.&#xD;&#xA; 6. Connect into other student activities that use 3D printing whether it be art or things like Robotics Competitions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />
