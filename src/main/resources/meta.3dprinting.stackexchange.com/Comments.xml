Mark asked the Meta question, because we had discovered a few limitations on this beta site ([migration paths](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224/flagging-a-question-for-migration), and [inlining video](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/226/is-the-inlining-videos-capability-turned-off-on-this-site) among them). This question is to see *if* we should turn it on or not." CreationDate="2017-06-07T08:47:04.063" UserId="4762" />

  <row Id="335" PostId="232" Score="0" Text="Like @Greenonline mentioned, my question was not specifically directed toward inline video; but, my question did refer to it so they did talk about inline video in their answer.  Like Tormod mentions, we may need to provide a justification to turn it on.  The standard they noted was for it to be &quot;only turned on if the community thinks it's necessary to improve the quality of a good portion of their question base&quot;.  I agree our site could benefit from inline video for some questions, but their standard is a pretty high bar.  Can we meet that?" CreationDate="2017-06-10T20:27:59.903" UserId="6417" />
